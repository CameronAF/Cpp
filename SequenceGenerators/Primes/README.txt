For a list of the primer numbers between 2 and 100. also see
  http://math.ucsd.edu/~wgarner/math187/unicity.pdf

HOW TO USE:
 1) User inputs the name between 2 and 300
     - A list of all primes is generated up to that number
 
ABOUT THE PROGRAM:
This is a program that asks for an upper range of numbers to search for prime numbers 
Starting at 2 and go up to the number the user inputted number. 
The user's number must be <= 300.

This program uses a function operator << that will write the content of a vector.
